### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ’¼ <b>I have recently accepted a job offer with Psycle</b>, a software development company. I am incredibly excited to start collaborating on projects with the team and be part of such an exciting organisation!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything and anything I can get involved in when it comes to frontend development. I have already sunk my teeth deeply in to JavaScript, CSS and HTML, along with associated libraries like ReactJS and SASS and I am now looking at:
- <b>Git flow</b> for collaborative version control.
- <b>Angular</b> to work on projects with Psycle.
- <b>Typescript</b> in order to work effectively in Angular.
- <b>BEM for css</b> to make my CSS/SCSS more readable and maintainable.
