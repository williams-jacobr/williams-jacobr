### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything and anything I can get involved in when it comes to frontend development. I have already sunk my teeth deeply in to JavaScript, CSS and HTML, along with associated libraries like ReactJS. I am now striving to put all this together in order to be able to use these skills in meaningful ways by focusing on how to make use of these skills in applications with true states.
